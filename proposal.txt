Webprog Final Project Proposal
=============================

Project Title: Shelf Manager for Baby Food
Your Name: Patrick Weber

Description
-----------
I want to create a small organizer for managing my baby food shelf. The application will help me keep track of which baby food items are stored on the shelf and in the freezer.
For store-bought products, I will use their EAN (European Article Number) for identification. For homemade food, I will manually enter the relevant details. All data will be stored in a MySQL database.

Milestone(s)
------------
Due to a lack of time, i do not have anything to present yet.

External libraries and code
---------------------------
I plan to use the following technologies:
Bootstrap for styling
Vanilla JS for client-side logic
Express for the backend
Prisma with MySQL for database interaction
An external API for retrieving product information by EAN
Possibly additional libraries as needed
The whole project will be dockerized

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I will primarily work independently, but will use:
GitHub for libraries
Stack Overflow for debugging
